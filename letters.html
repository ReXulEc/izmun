                    Dear precious delegates,<br><br>Welcome to the First Official İzfen Model United Nations Conference. I am Almina Beren Çağlayan, and I am proud to serve as the Secretary General of IZMUN'24. I think I should start by thanking all my valuable Executive Team Members. I would like to thank Yavuz Selim İpek, our Deputy Secretary General, Orçun Hasbahçeli, our General Director, Emre Özaydın, our Academic Advisor and İdil Şişek, our Assistant General Director, who worked day and night for IZMUN'24. I would also like to thank Durunaz Manav, Ata Bambul and Serra Erdem, who always supported me in every step I took to organize the conference.<br><br> 

IZMUN'24 will be the first Model United Nations Conference in the history of Izfen Schools. As it is obvious that firsts are always more memorable, my team and I have been working tirelessly to provide you with the best conference experience. Our conference offers you a platform where you can have a proper discussion, have an idea about the events happening in the world, improve your persuasion skills, consider different opinions and most importantly, do all this in a respectful manner.<br><br> 

In our first conference, we are hosting 9 unique committees, all of which have been carefully and intensively selected. As we set out to organize a conference that delegates of all levels can attend, we have fulfilled this goal with our committees that delegates can choose according to their own preferences and levels. We offer WHO (World Health Organization), UNDP (United Nations Development Program) as our entry level committees. The reports of these committees, which will lay the foundations of our main topic, will be of great importance. For our intermediate level committees we have ABC (Administrative and Budgetary Committee), INTERPOL (International Criminal Police Organization). We believe that you will all be able to gain different experiences in our committees, each different but with a common denominator. Finally, for our most advanced delegates, we offer ICJ (International Court of Justice), STV (Second Treaty of Versailles), UNSC (United Nations Security Council), G20 (Group of 20), JCC (Joint Crisis Committee). Of course, all of our committees are different from each other in terms of oratory and originality. Therefore, all our participants can develop themselves academically in the committee that best appeals to them. Of course, I would like to thank first and foremost my Deputy Secretary General and then all my Executive Members who played an active role in the planning of these events.<br><br>

At the same time, I would like to express my gratitude to the organization team for their devoted work in the field of organization.<br><br>

We are constantly working to provide you with the best experience both in terms of academy and organization. We are confident that all your expectations will be met and your needs will be provided.<br><br>

Finally, I would like to say that I look forward to seeing you all at our Izfen Model United Nations Conference.<br><br>

Respectfully,<br><br>

Almina Beren Çağlayan<br>
IZMUN'24 Secretary General

                        Dear participants,<br><br>
We are all honored by your participation in this unique conference. I am Orçun Hasbahçeli. It is truly an honor for me to hold this conference as the Director General at my own school.<br><br>

I cannot explain to you how important this conference is to me. Since the first conference I attended, the thought of holding my own conference has been like a dream for me. I still can't believe that this conference will happen.<br><br>

First of all, I would like to thank the entire organization and academic team. Everyone did their best and created this unique conference.<br>
I would like to thank Onat Güvenlir, who was with me the most during this process, Umut Hasbahçeli, who introduced me to conferences and was more than a brother to me, and the entire executive team.<br><br>

I look forward to seeing you at our conference. Welcome to IZMUN'24, everyone.<br><br>
Respectfully,<br><br>
Orçun Hasbahçeli<br>
IZMUN'24 Director General
